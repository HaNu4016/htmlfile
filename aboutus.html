    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Empowering Futures at CADMAX</h2>
        <p>At CADMAX, we are driven by a singular mission: to empower the youth of rural India, particularly from Adivasi communities, through skill development and education. Our commitment aligns seamlessly with the Swades Foundation's vision of creating sustainable livelihoods in rural areas.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>We envision a future where every young individual has access to quality education and training, enabling them to thrive in India’s burgeoning manufacturing sector. By equipping students with the skills they need, we aim to foster economic independence and support the Make in India initiative—positioning our country as a global leader in manufacturing.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>CADMAX is dedicated to bridging the skill gap in rural India. Our comprehensive training programs focus on practical skills that are in demand, ensuring our students are not just employable but are also prepared to excel in their chosen fields. We believe that education is the cornerstone of empowerment, and we strive to make it accessible to those who need it most.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <h4>Training Programs:</h4>
            <p>We provide free, high-quality training programs tailored to the needs of the manufacturing industry. Our curriculum is designed to equip students with both technical and soft skills.</p>
            <h4>Community Engagement:</h4>
            <p>We actively engage with local communities to raise awareness about the importance of skill development and to inspire students to pursue vocational training. Workshops and seminars are conducted regularly to keep the community informed.</p>
            <h4>Partnerships for Impact:</h4>
            <p>Collaborating with organizations like the Swades Foundation allows us to expand our reach and enhance the quality of our programs. Together, we can create lasting change.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Need for Support</h2>
        <p>While we have successfully trained numerous students, our current resources are dwindling. To continue offering free, high-quality training, we seek support from partners like the Swades Foundation. Your contribution will help us sustain our programs and open doors for deserving students who might otherwise miss out on these transformative opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>With your support, we aim to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase the employability of rural and Adivasi youth.</li>
                <li>Foster economic growth in local communities.</li>
                <li>Contribute to India’s manufacturing sector by creating a skilled workforce.</li>
                <li>Empower women through skill training, promoting gender equality in the workplace.</li>
                <li>Reduce migration by creating local job opportunities in the manufacturing sector.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
